# brainwaves
This is a Python script to get EEG data from Neurosky Mindwave Mobile device (http://store.neurosky.com/products/brainwave-starter-kit). Data is being fetched from Think Gear Connector (http://developer.neurosky.com/docs/doku.php?id=thinkgear_connector_tgc) who manages Bluetooth connection to the device and serves on localhost socket with JSON data for each of EEG bands. <br>Data is then saved into CSV file for further possible analysis.
